# think.google-analytics

Clojure library for accessing the Google Analytics reporting and management API.

This is ThinkTopic's EPL-compliance fork of [analytij](https://github.com/uswitch/analytij). 

* [Core Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/).
* [Management API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/mgmtReference/)

Although think.google-analytics aims to make the API more pleasant to use (than its Java or other equivalents) their query explorer is still really useful while developing data queries:
